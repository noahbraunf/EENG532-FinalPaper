\section{Introduction}

Not all IEEE conferences use the same template. For your paper to be
published in the conference proceedings, you must use this document as
both an instruction set and as a template into which you can type your
own text. If your paper does not conform to the required format, you
will be asked to fix it.

Papers which have been reviewed and accepted by the committee may
still have format problems identified later by the publisher. All
format problems which the publisher has requested you to fix must be
fixed before it can be published in the conference proceedings.

	{\bfseries\itshape
		Do not reuse your past papers as a template, even if your past papers
		conformed to the required format. To prepare your paper for
		submission, always download a fresh copy of this template from the
		conference website and read the format instructions in this template
		before you use it for your paper.
	}

IEEE PDF eXpress checks your paper for IEEE Xplore compatibility. IEEE
PDF eXpress does not check for format compliance. When your paper in
PDF passes the checking by IEEE PDF eXpress, it does not mean that
your paper conforms to the format requirements specified by the
conference. You must check your paper for format compliance.

Conversion to PDF may cause problems in the resulting PDF or expose
problems in your source document. Before submitting your final paper
in PDF, check that the format in your paper in PDF conforms to this
template. Specifically, check the appearance of the title and author
block, the appearance of section headings, document margins, column
width, column spacing, and other features such as section numbers,
figure numbers, table numbers and equation numbers. In summary, you
must proofread your final paper in PDF before submission.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Page Limit and Page Layout}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Page Limit}

The initial submission for review must contain a minimum of 3 pages and a maximum of 4 pages. Papers longer than 4 pages will not be considered. For all accepted papers, the final paper must be a maximum of 4 pages. If authors choose to be considered for the MWTL special issue, the submitted paper must adhere to four pages maximum, where the second column of the last page can only contain references and acknowledgements. In addition, every paper published in the MWTL special issue must contain the footnote: “This article was presented at the IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS 2023), San Diego, CA, USA, June 11–16, 2023”. See also the MWTL instructions on the IMS website.

You must not reduce margins or font-sizes or spacing to meet the page
limit. You must not change the required formats to meet the page limit.

In summary, you must follow the formats as shown in this template (e.g.
acknowledgments must be formatted as a separate section and not as a
paragraph, single author block centered to the page must be used instead of
multiple author blocks). You will be asked to fix these format problems if
any such format deviations are detected.

An easy way to comply with the conference paper format requirements is to
use this document as a template and simply type your text into it.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Page Layout}

Your paper must use a page size corresponding to US Letter which is
8.5\textquotedbl (215.9mm) wide and 11\textquotedbl (279.4mm) long.

The margins must be set as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item	top = 0.75\textquotedbl (19mm)
	\item	bottom = 1\textquotedbl (25.4mm)
	\item	left = right = 0.63\textquotedbl (16mm).
\end{itemize}

Your paper must be in two column format with a space of 0.25\textquotedbl (6.3mm)
between columns.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Page Style}
\label{sec:page style}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Text Font of Entire Document}

The entire document must be mainly in Times New Roman or Times font.
Other fonts (e.g., Symbol font), if needed for special purposes, may be
used sparingly. Type 3 fonts must not be used.

Required font sizes are shown in Table 1.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Title}
\label{sec:title}

Title must be in 18pt regular font style (i.e., not bold and not
italic). Title must be in single-column format and must be centered to
the page.

Every word in a title must be capitalized except for short minor words
such as ``a'', ``an'', ``and'', ``as'', ``at'', ``by'', ``for'', ``from'', ``if'', ``in'',
``into'', ``on'', ``or'', ``of'', ``the'', ``to'', and ``with''.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Author Block}
\label{sec:author}

An author block consists of author names, author affiliations and
email addresses. Your paper must contain one author block immediately
below the title. The author block must be in single-column format and
must be centered to the page. The author block must be in 12pt
regular font.

The author block must not show any professional title (e.g., Managing
Director), any academic title (e.g., Dr.) or any membership of any
professional organization (e.g., Senior Member IEEE).

Do not split an author name into two lines, i.e., an author name must
appear entirely on the same line. To avoid confusion, the family name
must be written as the last part of each author name (e.g., John A.K.
Smith) and must not be shown in all uppercase. To avoid incorrect
author name indexing by digital libraries, an author with more than
one family name should consider hyphenating the multiple family names
(e.g., Francisco Santos-Leal).

Each affiliation must include, at the very least, the name of the company
and the name of the country where the author is based (e.g.,  Causal
Productions, Australia). Do not show physical address, phone number or fax
number.  Each different affiliation must be on a separate line. Same
company name with a different location must be treated as if it were a
different affiliation.

Email address must be shown for the corresponding author. Email
addresses for all other authors are optional.

All affiliation markers must consist of a single unique character in
superscript style. Affiliation markers used in this template are: ``\#'',
``\$'', ``*'', ``\textasciicircum''. A unique affiliation marker must
be used for each different affiliation.

All email address markers must consist of a single unique character in
superscript style. Email address markers used in this template are:
``1'', ``2'', ``3''. A unique email address marker must be used for each
different author who shows an email address on the manuscript. Authors
who do not show an email address must not have an email address marker
after their name.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Section Headings}
\label{sec:headings}

No more than 3 levels of headings should be used. All headings must be
in 10pt font. Every word in a heading must be capitalized except for
short minor words as listed in Section III.B. A heading must not be
the last non-blank line in a column.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Level-1 Heading}

A level-1 heading must be in small caps, centered and numbered using
uppercase Roman numerals (e.g., heading of section I).  The only
exception is in the case of the acknowledgment section heading and the
references section heading. These two level-1 section headings must
not have section numbers.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Level-2 Heading}

A level-2 heading must be italic, justified and numbered using an
uppercase alphabetic letter followed by a period (e.g., heading of
section III.D).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Level-3 Heading}
\label{sec:level3heading}

A level-3 heading must be italic, justified and numbered using Arabic
numerals followed by a right parenthesis (e.g., heading of section
III.D.3).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Paragraphs}

All paragraphs must have an indentation of 0.2\textquotedbl (5.1mm) on the first
line. There must not be any spacing before and after a paragraph. All
paragraphs must be justified.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Figures and tables must be centered in the column. Large figures and
tables may span across both columns. Any figure or table that takes up
more than one column width must be placed either at the top or at the
bottom of the page, as shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2.

Graphics may be full color. All colors will be retained in the
proceedings.  Use only solid fill colors which contrast well both on
screen and on black-and-white hardcopy, as shown in Fig. 1, with the
black and red curves. Note that simulation and measurement are clearly
distinguished through different colors and different line styles.
Also, the axis fonts and any labels are not smaller than the figure
caption font. Do not attempt to overload the plot with too many
separate curves; each curve should be distinguishable.

Fig. 2a shows an example of a low-resolution image which would not be
acceptable, whereas Fig. 2b shows an example of an image with adequate
resolution. Check that the resolution is adequate to reveal the
important detail in the figure.

Check all figures in your paper both on screen and on a
black-and-white hardcopy. When you check your paper on a
black-and-white hardcopy, ensure the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the colors used in each figure contrast well
	\item the image used in each figure is clear
	\item all text labels in each figure are legible.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=65mm]{figures/fig_1.eps}
	\caption{A sample line graph using colors which contrast well both on screen
		and on a black-and-white hardcopy.  Figure caption with more than one line
		must be justified. Figure caption with only one line must be centered.}

		justified. Figure caption with only one line must be centered.}
	\label{fig:bird}
\end{figure*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Figure Numbers and Table Numbers}

Figures and tables must be numbered using Arabic numerals (e.g., 1, 2,
etc).

Figures have their own sequence of numbers starting from Fig. 1.
Figures must be numbered consecutively in the order they appear in
your paper.

Tables have their own sequence of numbers starting from Table 1.
Tables must be numbered consecutively in the order they appear in your
paper.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Figure Captions and Table Captions}

Captions must be in 8pt regular font. A single-line caption must be
centered (e.g., Fig. 2, Table 2) whereas a multi-line caption must be
justified (e.g., Fig. 1, Fig. 3, Table 1).

A figure caption must be placed below the associated figure whereas a
table caption must be placed above the associated table.

A caption must be kept together with its associated figure or table,
i.e., they must not be separated into different columns or onto
different pages.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Page Numbers, Headers and Footers}

Page numbers, headers and footers must not be used.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Links and Bookmarks}

During the processing of papers for publication, all hypertext links
and section bookmarks will be removed from papers and the affected
text will be changed to black color. If you need to refer to an
Internet email address or URL in your paper, you must write the
address or URL fully in your text in regular font style and black
color.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Equations}

Equations should be centered in the column and numbered sequentially.
Place the equation number to the right of the equation within a parenthesis, with
right justification within its column. An example would be

\begin{equation}
	\oint E \cdot dL = - \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \iint B \cdot dS
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
	\nabla \times H = J + \frac{\partial D}{\partial t}.
\end{equation}

Note that a period is used to properly punctuate the previous
sentence.  It is placed at the end of the second equation. Make sure
that all parts of your equations are legible and are not too small to
read. When referring to an equation, use the number within
parenthesis. For example, you would usually refer to the second
equation as ``(2)'' rather than ``equation (2)''.

\subsection{References}

The heading of the References section must not be numbered. All
reference items must be in 8pt font. Number the reference items
consecutively in square brackets (e.g., [1]).

When referring to a reference item, simply use the reference number,
as in [2]. Do not use ``Ref. [3]'' or ``Reference [3]'' except at the
beginning of a sentence, e.g., ``Reference [3] shows \ldots''. Multiple
references are each numbered with separate brackets (e.g., [2], [3],
[4]--[6]).

Examples of reference items of different categories shown in the
References section include the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item	example of a book in \cite{IEEEexample:book}
	\item	example of a book in a series in \cite{IEEEexample:bookwithseriesvolume}
	\item	example of a journal article in \cite{IEEEexample:article_typical}
	\item	example of a conference paper in \cite{IEEEexample:confwithpaper}
	\item	example of a patent in \cite{IEEEexample:uspat}
	\item	example of a website in \cite{IEEEexample:IEEEwebsite}
	\item	example of a web page in \cite{IEEEexample:shellCTANpage}
	\item	example of a databook as a manual in \cite{IEEEexample:motmanual}
	\item	example of a datasheet in \cite{IEEEexample:datasheet}
	\item	example of a master's thesis in \cite{IEEEexample:masterstype}
	\item	example of a technical report in \cite{IEEEexample:techreptype}
	\item	example of a standard in \cite{IEEEexample:standard}.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Balancing Columns on a Page}

There is no requirement to balance both columns on any page including
the last page, i.e., both columns are not required to be vertically
aligned at the bottom. Do not change the vertical spacing to align the
bottoms of both columns.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Review Submission vs. Final Submission}

For review submission, in addition to other requirements, the
	{\bfseries\itshape IMS double-blind reviewing policy requires that
		all author details and the acknowledgment section be hidden.}
For final submission, you must ensure that all text which has been
hidden for review submission is unhidden.  Section V and section VI
provide hints on how to hide and unhide information in LaTeX and WORD
respectively.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Information for LaTeX Users Only}

\subsection{Information to Hide for Review Submission}

To hide text for blind review submission, please ensure that the following
two lines in the .tex file appear uncommented and commented as shown
below:\\
\hspace*{\parindent}\parbox[t]{2in}{%
{\textbackslash}IMSthispaperforblindreview\\
$\cdots$\\
\% {\textbackslash}IMSthispaperforfinalpublication\strut
}

\subsection{Information to Unhide for Final Submission}

For final submission, you must ensure that all text which has been
hidden for blind review submission is visible by commenting the following
two lines as shown:

\noindent\hspace*{\parindent}\parbox[t]{2in}{%
\% {\textbackslash}IMSthispaperforblindreview\\
$\cdots$\\
{\textbackslash}IMSthispaperforfinalpublication
}

\subsection{All Other Must-Reads}

There are important differences between the IEEE format and the IMS
format, so you must use all files provided in the IMS LaTeX template.

If the appearance is different from what is shown in this template,
then the cause may be the use of conflicting style files in your .tex
file (e.g., latex8.sty).  You must remove all such conflicting style
files.

For the table caption to appear above the table, you must place the
table caption at the start of the table definition and before the
table cells in your .tex file.

% Example to demonstrate how to make the caption appear above the table data:
% \begin{table}
% \caption{My table caption}
% \begin{tabular}{lll}
%   ... my table cells here ...
% \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

Authors must use the {\textbackslash}raggedbottom option (as used in
this template file) to avoid LaTeX inserting inconsistent and
sometimes large spacing around section headings, around captions and
around paragraphs.

You must follow the formats as shown in this template.  You must not
use alternative styles which are not used in this template (e.g.
two-author block).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Information for WORD Users Only}

\subsection{Information to Hide for Review Submission}

To hide text for blind review submission, select the text to be
hidden, left click to select the ``Font'' panel, and then check
``Hidden'' under the heading ``Effects''. {\bfseries\itshape To keep
the page layout unchanged, for each hidden line, you must insert one
blank line using the same style as that of the hidden text.}

\subsection{Information to Unhide for Final Submission}

For final submission, you must ensure that all text which has been
hidden for blind review submission is unhidden. Simply select the
entire WORD file, left click to select the ``Font'' panel, and then
uncheck ``Hidden'' under the heading ``Effects''.  Remove all blank
lines you have inserted as placeholders for the hidden text.

\subsection{All Other Must-Reads}

You must use the styles in Table 2 to format your paper.  To format
using a style name, open the ``Styles'' task pane under ``Home'',
select the text to be formatted, then select an appropriate style in
the ``Styles'' task pane.

When the heading styles in Table 2 are used (e.g., ``IMS Heading 1''
style), section numbers are no longer required to be typed in because
they will be automatically numbered by WORD. Similarly, reference
items will be automatically numbered by WORD when the ``IMS Reference
Item'' style is used.

Section headings must not be in all uppercase. Capitalize the headings
and then format them using an appropriate style from Table 2.

Caption width must be the same as the column width or the page width
excluding the margins. You must type the caption as a separate new
paragraph and then format the caption using an appropriate style from
Table 2. Captions must not be placed into a table or a text box
because it is difficult to set the caption width correctly within
these structures. For the same reason, insert caption command, group
command or other similar commands must not be used.

Reference items must not be formatted as a table. You must use the
appropriate styles from Table 2 to format the reference items.

After changing from single column format to two column format (e.g.
after Table 2), always make sure that both the column width and the
column spacing are the same as specified in the last paragraph of
section II.B.

If your WORD document contains equations, you must not save your WORD
document from ``.docx'' to ``.doc'' because when doing so, WORD will
convert all equations to images of unacceptably low resolution.

\section{Conclusion}

The format of this template was adapted by Causal Productions mainly
from the IEEE LaTeX class file. There are important differences
between the IEEE format and the IMS format, so IMS authors must use
only the latest version of the IMS templates.

IMS offers US Letter templates for LaTeX and WORD. The version of
this template is V6. Changes from V5 to V6 are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item	page limit in section II.A, including updated information on page
	      formatting requirements for final papers for proceedings or MWTL submission
	\item For LaTeX version, show LaTeX double-blind instructions first
	\item	For WORD version, show WORD double-blind instructions first
	\item	list of changes from previous version to current version.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Acknowledgment}

% the following macro \IMSdisplayacksection makes its argument visible for the
% final paper, but hides its argument for the blind-review paper while keeping
% a blank vertical space of the same size.  The actual text of the acknowledgement
% is defined inside the macro \IMSacktext so that multiple paragraphs will be
% displayed or hidden correctly.

\newcommand{\IMSacktext}{%
	The headings of the Acknowledgment section and the References section
	must not be numbered.

	Causal Productions wishes to acknowledge Michael Shell and other
	contributors for developing and maintaining the IEEE LaTeX class file
