  abstract = { A method is proposed and experimentally explored for in-situ
              calibration of complex transmission data for superconducting
              microwave resonators. This cryogenic calibration method accounts
              for the instrumental transmission response between the vector
              network analyzer reference plane and the device calibration plane.
              Once calibrated, the observed resonator response is analyzed in
              detail by two approaches. The first, a phenomenological model based
              on physically realizable rational functions, enables the extraction
              of multiple resonance frequencies and widths for coupled resonators
              without explicit specification of the circuit network. In the
              second, an ABCD-matrix representation for the distributed
              transmission line circuit is used to model the observed response
              from the characteristic impedance and propagation constant. When
              used in conjunction with electromagnetic simulations, the kinetic
              inductance fraction can be determined with this method with an
              accuracy of 2\%. Datasets for superconducting microstrip and
              coplanar-waveguide resonator devices were investigated and a
              recovery within 1\% of the observed complex transmission amplitude
              was achieved with both analysis approaches. The experimental
              configuration used in microwave characterization of the devices and
              self-consistent constraints for the electromagnetic constitutive
              relations for parameter extraction are also presented. },

  abstract = {We introduce an improved microwave calibration method for use in a
              cryogenic environment, based on a traditional three-standard
              calibration, the Thru-Reflect-Line (TRL) calibration. The modified
              calibration method takes advantage of additional information from
              multiple measurements of an ensemble of realizations of a
              superconducting resonator, as a new pseudo-Open standard, to
              correct errors in the TRL calibration. We also demonstrate an
              experimental realization of this in situ broadband cryogenic
              calibration system utilizing cryogenic switches. All calibration
              measurements are done in the same thermal cycle as the measurement
              of the resonator (requiring only an additional 20 min), thus
              avoiding 4 additional thermal cycles for traditional TRL
              calibration (which would require an additional 12 days). The
              experimental measurements on a wave-chaotic microwave billiard
              verify that the new method significantly improves the measured
              scattering matrix of a high-quality-factor superconducting
              resonator.},
